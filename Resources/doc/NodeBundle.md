# NodeBundle

## Chainrouter implementation in NodeBundle

The KunstmaanNodeBundle implements the [Symfony CMF](http://cmf.symfony.com/) [RoutingExtra](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/RoutingExtraBundle) bundle.

### Chainrouter?

The default Symfony 2.1 router does not support multiple routers. To allow more flexibility, the Symfony CMF Chainrouter was chosen to support multiple routers. An example of the flexibility gained is the KunstmaanNodeBundle:SlugController routing was changed to no longer allow routing inside entity objects. This was previously needed to achieve some goals but can be replaced by adding a custom router.

### Implementation

* Composer.json now includes a dependency for "symfony-cmf/routing-extra-bundle".
* The config.yml includes the required configuration values for "symfony_cmf_routing_extra".
* There is an extra service in services.yml called "kunstmaan_node.slugrouter".

### Adding a router

To add a router simple create a service and tag it with 'router' and a priority. The default Symfony 2.1 router has priority 100. For more information about the Chainrouter see the official Symfony CMF [RoutingExtra documentation](http://symfony-cmf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/bundles/routing-extra.html).

### SlugController and SlugRouter

The SlugController is now accessed through the SlugRouter (Kunstmaan\NodeBundle\Router\SlugRouter) and handles locales and multilanguage support. The SlugRouter will need to have 2 or 3 settings in order to route the requests in the correct manner to the SlugController:

* multilanguage: is the first parameter in the url a language or not?
* defaultlocale: the default locale if the website is not multilanguage or there is no language given
* requiredlocales: used to validate the language given in the url, required only for multilanguage sites

If an url is requested and there is no language or slug given, the system will fall back to the default locale and an empty slug ('').

## Configurable Action Menu

Configuring the action or sub action menu of pages is simply a matter of connecting an event listener
to the *KunstmaanNodeBundle/Helper/Event/Events::CONFIGURE_ACTION_MENU* or the
*KunstmaanNodeBundle/Helper/Event/Events::CONFIGURE_SUB_ACTION_MENU* event:

```yaml
# src/Acme/MainBundle/Resources/config/services.yml
services:
    acme_hello.configure_sub_actions_menu_listener:
        class: Acme\MainBundle\EventListener\ConfigureActionsMenuListener
        arguments: ["@doctrine.orm.entity_manager", "@router"]
        tags:
            - { name: 'kernel.event_listener', event: 'kunstmaan_node.configureSubActionMenu', method: 'onSubActionMenuConfigure' }
```

and in the listener function you can now modify the menu:

```php
/**
 * @param \Kunstmaan\NodeBundle\Event\ConfigureActionMenuEvent $event
 */
public function onSubActionMenuConfigure(ConfigureActionMenuEvent $event)
{
    $menu = $event->getMenu();
    $activeNodeVersion = $event->getActiveNodeVersion();

    if (!is_null($activeNodeVersion)) {
        $menu->addChild('subaction.hello_world', array('uri' => $this->router->generate('AcmeMainBundle_Hello_World')));
    }
}
```

## Nodes

The Node consists out of 4 elements. You have the actual [Node](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanNodeBundle/blob/master/Entity/Node.php) which contains multiple translations [NodeTranslation](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanNodeBundle/blob/master/Entity/NodeTranslation.php).
For each language your Node will have a [NodeTranslation](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanNodeBundle/blob/master/Entity/NodeTranslation.php). This allows for your node to work independently from other languages. Your node can be online in English, but still offline in French. The NodeTranslation will also contain the 'Title' and 'Slug' for your Node for that language.
The NodeTranslation holds your node's versions inside a language. We currently have 2 version states : 'Draft' and 'Public'. The public version will be publicly accessible when online, the draft version won't. You can have a draft version while there's still a public version online. Because of this, you can create a new version of your page while the old one is still available online. When your new version is ready, all you have to do to set it publicly accessible and replace the old version is to publish it.
The [NodeVersion](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanNodeBundle/blob/master/Entity/NodeVersion.php) holds information regarding the owner (the user who created this version), the time of creation and last update, the original version this version originated from and a reference to the Entity it holds. For each new version, a clone of your entity will be made.

The standard usage for Node is as the page in your website. The bundle contains a '[AbstractPage](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanNodeBundle/blob/master/Entity/AbstractPage.php)' class which can be extended to create your own pages. Each Node will have a reference to its parent and as such you can create a whole tree structure in your website's navigation.

## Retrieval

TODO : Documntation on how to retrieve certain nodes, node translations and node versions.

## Events

TODO : Add documentation on which events exists and how they can be used.

## Slugs & Router

TODO : Write down how slugs and the router works.

## Known Issues

* Even though you click on 'Save as draft' after creating and modifying pageparts on your public version, the modifications will also be saved to the public version. It is advised to first "Save as draft" before you start altering pageparts.
